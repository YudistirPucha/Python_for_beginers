# Python_for_beginers
So i started learning python recently on one of those online courses website and this small program is what I have learned so far

The program askes user to enter a name and their id and this is then added to a .txt file which is created once the program run. 

Again I am new to python so I will be improving this little program to something more complex but for now its just show the basic concepts and syntax to help me understand this amazin language
